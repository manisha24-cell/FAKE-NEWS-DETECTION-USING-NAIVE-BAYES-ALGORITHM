# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION-USING-NAIVE-BAYES-ALGORITHM
Currently, many people are using the internet as a central platform to find the information about reality in world and need to be continue. As mentioned above we will create fake news detection model which detect the reality of the news . The system is a web application which help user to detect the fake news. We use various NLP and preprocessing methodologies like tokenization, stop words removal, lemmatization, stemming and machine learning classification algorithm i.e.naive bayes, to build a model that differentiates between fake news and real news and analyze the performance of these. We have given the text box where the user will load the data from dataset and after that it gives the reality of it.
